Disclaimer: We don't own or have any legal claim over the logos and names used in the app we've built. Our prototype was originally a solution to the Myntra-Jabong hackathon conducted by Hackerearth in 2019. Since we did not win the hackathon, we believe that we have all legal rights over the code written by us. According to us, Myntra-Jabong has no legal rights over our idea and code and hence we would like to submit our idea and code for this competition. The idea can be used for any online fashion retail service similar to Myntra. We do not wish to violate any legal rights of any company.

Myntra Go is aimed to be an app extension of existing Myntra App (or any other retail app). The prototype of the same is provided here. Instructions to run the app:

1. Download the project from GitHub onto a desktop with Android Studio installed in it. 
2. Unzip the project 
3. Go to Android Studio and open the project via Android Studio. 
4. Connect your cell phone (with developer options enabled) to the PC. 
5. Switch from emulator mode to your cell phone and click run. 
6. Once the app is launched on your phone, a window appears with a button labelled 'Go'. Click on Go to begin. 
7. Give the app required permissions. The camera will start. 
8. Wait for 2-3 seconds for an object (product image) to appear. 
9. Click on the product image within 12 seconds of it's appearance to get the promo code for it. 
10. A pop up window with the promo code appears. Click on the Get info button in the pop up to view product details. These details can be screenshot for further use. 
11. Click back. Tapping once on the pop up window will make it disappear. 

12. In step 9, if the product image is not tapped within 12 seconds, it disappears and the promo code can't be viewed for that product. (Thus making the user take a quick decision about buying the product).

*The actual version of the app will include in app images from the retail app for display and also a Geolocation feature which will enable a product images to appear only at certain locations for certain intervals of time.
